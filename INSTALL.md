## Installation

### Vagrant development servers.
 1. Install an SSH keypair on the host machine if one doesn't exist already.
 1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). OS X [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) users, consider easy installation via [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io).
 1. Run the following command to checkout this project: ```git clone https://github.com/thehunmonkgroup/freeswitch-kickstart.git```
 1. From the command line, change to the <code>vagrant</code> directory, and you'll find <code>settings.sh.example</code>. Copy that file in the same directory to <code>settings.sh</code>.
 1. Edit to taste, the default values (which are the commented out values in the example config) will most likely work just fine.
 1. Follow instructions below for configuring pillar data and SSL certs.
 1. From the command line, run <code>./development-environment-init.sh</code>.
 1. Once the script successfully completes the pre-flight checks, it will automatically handle the rest of the installation and setup. Relax, grab a cup of chai, and watch the setup process roll by on screen. :)
 1. If the setup script finds an SSH pubkey in the default location of the host's HOME directory, it will automatically install that pubkey to the VM. The end of the script outputs optional configuration you can add to your <code>.ssh/config</code> file, to enable easy root SSH access to the server.
 1. SSH into the VM, and as root, run ```start-conference.sh```
 1. Visit <code>https://dev.freeswitch.local</code> in your browser, and you should see the main page for FreeSWTICH's [Verto Communicator](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Verto+Communicator).
 1. Try out a video call! *(the defaults under the 'Settings' link should work without adjustment)*
 1. The installed virtual machine can be controlled like any other Vagrant VM. See [this Vagrant cheat sheet](http://notes.jerzygangi.com/vagrant-cheat-sheet) for more details.
 1. If for any reason the installation fails, or you just want to completely remove the installed virtual machine, run the <code>vagrant/kill-development-environment.sh</code> script from the command line.

##### Working with the Vagrant FreeSWITCH checkout

The setup script clones a git repository for FreeSWITCH to the host machine, in the directory specified by the <code>FREESWITCH_GIT_DIR</code> setting in <code>settings.sh</code> (<code>${HOME}/git/freeswitch</code> by default). This directory is sync'd with the VM, which allows editing files directly from the checkout. Once the initial setup of the source code repository is done, you have full control over what branch/tag/commit to rebuild FreeSWITCH from *(default is to build from latest master)*.

The following directories will probably be of the most interest:
 * <code>src</code>: The source code for FreeSWITCH.
 * <code>html5/verto/verto_communicator/src</code>: The source code for Verto Communicator.

##### Working with the Vagrant VM
 * The virtual machine can be started, stopped, and restarted from the host using the <code>vagrant/manage-vm.sh</code> script. Run without arguments for usage.
 * The following scripts are available to be run while SSH'd into the VM:
   * <code>start-conference.sh</code>: Starts a development web server for Verto Communicator. The server will watch all files in the Verto Communicator package, and rebuild client-side assets on any changes.
   * <code>rebuild-freeswitch.sh</code>: If the source code for FreeSWITCH is updated in your local checkout (most likely by a merge from upstream), this script can be used to rebuild FreeSWITCH.
   * <code>rebuild-conference.sh</code>: If the source code for Verto Communicator is updated such that its dependencies change, this script can be used to rebuild the dependencies.

### Remote (usually production) servers.
 1. Start with a fresh [Debian 8.x](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie) install.
 1. Make sure the hostname of the server is set to the fully qualified domain name wanted for the installation. You can use the hostname command to set it, eg. ```hostname www.example.com```
 1. Load ```production/debian_bootstrap.sh``` to the server, make sure it's executable, and execute it.
 1. When it completes, follow the instructions below for configuring pillar data and SSL certs *(the bootstrap script installs freeswitch-kickstart at <code>/var/local/git/freeswitch-kickstart</code>)*.
 1. Run ```salt-call state.highstate```
 1. Visit <code>https://[your-hostname]/verto-communicator</code> in your browser to access Verto Communicator.

##### Working with the remote server

 * It's important to note that Salt is set up to trigger a rebuild of FreeSWITCH if the configured Git revision *(the pillar setting <code>software:freeswitch:git:revision</code>)* is updated with new commits. This can happen if the setting is pointing to a branch. Since the default setting is <code>master</code>, you are highly encouraged to set this to something stable on your production server! *(like a commit hash or tag, or a stable branch used for production rollouts)*.
 * The following scripts are available to be run on the server:
   * <code>rebuild-conference.sh</code>: If the source code for Verto Communicator is updated, this script can be used to rebuild it.

### Configuring pillar data

 * In the <code>salt/pillar/server</code> directory, you'll find an example configuration file.
 * Copy the file in the same directory, removing the .example extension. Use the appropriate example based on the installation environment *(<code>development.sls</code> for development/Vagrant installs, <code>production.sls</code> for production installs)*.
 * Edit the configurations to taste. You can reference <code>salt/salt/vars.jinja</code> to see what variables are available, and the defaults for each.

### Configuring SSL certificates

You need valid SSL certificates in order for WebRTC to function properly, there are two options, easy and hard:

 1. For Vagrant installs:
   * Do nothing. :) The default certs provided in <code>salt/salt/etc/ssl/</code> work out of the box with the default configured <code>dev.freeswitch.local</code> domain *(the site will show as insecure in the browser, and WebRTC connections work)*.

 1. For remote/production servers:
   * Get some from a SSL certificates from a provider. Note that the common name of the certificate must match the hostname on production servers, and the <code>SALT_MINION_ID</code> setting in <code>settings.sh</code> for Vagrant installs -- this allows Salt to auto configure the setup.
   * Place the following files into the <code>salt/salt/etc/ssl/</code> directory:
     * The server's SSL certificate.
     * The server's SSL private key.
     * The SSL chain file or root certificate authority.
   * In the pillar configuration, set the names of each file you installed in the <code>server:ssl</code> section *(see <code>production.sls.example</code> for the correct approach)*.

# Dialing into a videoconference as a moderator

Extensions 3600-3699 have been added to allow moderator access to the videoconference. Simply log in using any default user from 1000-1007 with the default password, then dial into any of the 3600-3699 extensions to become a moderator.

### Caveats

 * For Vagrant installs, make sure you have the freeswitch-kickstart Git checkout where you want it in your filesystem before you start the build -- this location is stored in the Vagrant configuration for the VM and referenced on boot. If you do move the Git checkout, you'll need to edit the <code>Vagrantfile</code> for the VM and adjust the path as necessary.
 * The Salt bootstrapping process can take quite awhile, so be patient.
 * If some of the Salt configuration steps fail, it's most often some kind of transient error (network or server glitch or outage) -- usually running <code>salt-call state.highstate</code> again will rectify the errors.
 * The project intends to support only the latest development branch installation by default, older branches may also install, but will not be actively maintained.
 * None of the bootstrapping scripts will work on Windows.
